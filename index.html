    <button onclick="unlockSecret()">Enter Password</button>
    <p id="secretContent" class="hidden">🎁 If you’re reading this, it means you cared enough to unlock it, and that alone already says so much about you.
I want you to know something important: you are deeply appreciated, not only for the happy moments you give, but also for your honesty, your effort, and the quiet strength you carry even on days when things feel heavy.
Life doesn’t always give us perfect days, perfect timing, or perfect versions of ourselves — but even in the imperfect moments, you remain someone truly special. Your laughter, your thoughts, your presence… they leave a mark in ways you may never fully realize.
On your birthday, I don’t wish you a life without struggles. I wish you the courage to face them, the softness to rest when you’re tired, and people who choose you, understand you, and stay.
May this year bring you growth without pressure, happiness without guilt, and love that feels safe, calm, and real. And whenever you doubt yourself, I hope you remember this: someone out there is silently rooting for you, believing in you, and wishing you all the good things this world has to offer.

Happy Birthday 🤍
You deserve more than you think, today and always. 💕</p>

    <h2>🎁 Last but not least</h2>
    <p>I don’t say this enough, but I’m really grateful for you.
For the laughs, the late talks, the quiet understanding, and the way you make heavy days feel lighter just by being there. You matter more than you know ✨</p>
